# Open-source platforms and tools for ICT4D

Let’s compile a list of open-source platforms and tools for <a href="http://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/ict">ICT4D</a> (information and communication technologies for development). A list of open-source solutions could help <a href="https://www.devex.com/news/global-development-what-you-need-to-know-74999">relief and development</a> organizations to discover free platforms and tools, extend existing solutions, and avoid duplicating each other’s work. It could also help organizations avoid getting locked into long-term relationships with individual vendors.

This list does not in any way represent an endorsement of technologies, organizations, or approaches. 

For more details about this project, see this [blog post](http://www.joshtong.net/blog/lets-create-a-list-of-open-source-tools-for-ict4d/).
